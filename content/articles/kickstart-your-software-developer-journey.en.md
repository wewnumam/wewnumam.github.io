“If you have a dream, you can spend a lifetime studying, planning and getting ready for it. What you should be doing is getting started.” – Drew Huston&#x20;

---

## 🚀 1. From Dream to Action

* **Believe & Begin**: Nothing changes until you take that first step.
* **Trust the Process**: Learn, experiment, and adapt—growth happens in motion.
* **Goal‑Driven Planning**: Define your end goal and work backwards to map out the skills and milestones you need.&#x20;

---

## 🎓 2. Learning to Code (and Beyond)

1. **The Big Picture**

   * What can this technology do?
   * Where does it fit in real‑world projects?
2. **Getting Started**

   * Examine actual source code of open‑source projects.
   * Identify basic constructs (variables, loops, conditionals, functions, I/O, Boolean logic).
3. **The 20% Rule**

   * Focus on the core features that give 80% of the value.
   * Master library/framework usage over language minutiae.

> ✏️ “You’ll spend perhaps 90% of your time figuring out why your code doesn’t work.”&#x20;

## 🤝 5. Networking & Job Hunting

   * Source Control & DevOps: automate deployments, own the full lifecycle.
2. **Quality & Testing**

   * Embrace TDD and unit testing to reduce risk.
   * A good dev tests their own code before handing it off.

   * Hypothesize, isolate, assert, and prevent recurrence.
4. **Communication & Teamwork**

   * Translate business requirements into technical solutions.
   * Lead by example, avoid drama, and manage conflict constructively.&#x20;

* **Leadership**: Inspire through vision and by doing—don’t just mandate, model.
* **Personal Branding**:

  * Clear, consistent message + visual identity.
  * Build reputation by freely adding value to others.
* **Adaptability**: Embrace uncertainty—stay employable by learning new tools and domains.
* **Value‑Based Pricing** (for freelancers): Charge based on outcomes, not hours.&#x20;
