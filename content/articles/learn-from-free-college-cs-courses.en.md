# How To Audit Courses
## What is Learning?
> "The activity or process of gaining new knowledge or skills by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something" ~Merriam Webster

## Learning Through Institutions
1. Structured
2. Sequential
3. Compulsory
4. Experiential
*Other forms of education, such as home-schooling, also share several of these qualities*.

## Autodidactic Learning
- You determine the topic you study, the source you learn from, and when you learn it.
	1. Flexible
	2. Non-Sequential
	3. Other Incentives
	4. Independent
- Self-proclaimed "unlettered man."
- Less than 3 years of formal schooling.
- Partly taught himself how to code.
- Learning on the Internet.

## Ask Yourself...
- What do I want to learn?
- Why do I want to learn it?
- When do I want to learn it?
- Are there prerequisites?
- Are these resources accurate and trustworthy?

## Learning on the Web
- Once you "learn" how to learn on the web, you can achieve anything!
- The ability to learn on the web is among the most valuable skills you can have.

# What Does It Mean to 'Audit'?
## What is Auditing a Course?
- Access to lectures/notes.
- No grade/credit.

## Insight
- Ensure your topic aligns with your goals.
- Popular topics: python, algorithms, data structures.
- Experiment before committing!

# How to Choose the Right Course
## What's your learning style? 
- How do you prefer to learn?
- *Visual*: Do you prefer to learn with graphical depictions such as charts/images?
- *Auditory*: Do you prefer to learn when listening to others present, such as in lectures?
- *Kinesthetic*: Do you prefer to learn through creating hands-on projects?
- *Reading/Writing*: Do you prefer to learn by completing worksheets, notes, or flashcards?

## What's Your Time Commitment?

2. Syllabus (outline of course).
3. Prerequisites.
4. Explore course pages.
5. Sample courses.

## How Do You Define Success?
- Know what the course offers before you dive in!
- Is it match with your goals?
- Track your progress!

# Making the Most of Your Audit
- **Set realistic schedules.** Evaluate how you can work a course audit into your schedule.
- **Be organized!** Make an actionable plan and stick to it as best you can. Set a reasonable schedule for yourself.
- **Be consistent!** Ensure you are studying at the pace you set for yourself. Re-evaluate if issues arise.
- **Be studious!** Review material frequently! Stay disciplined and try to avoid multitasking while learning.
- **Be motivated!** Set short-term goals and reward yourself when you achieve them!
- **Be persistent!** It's impossible to "fail" when you're in charge! If you're struggling with something, take your time.
- **Be accountable!** Find someone to ask you about the course, or put yourself into a position to be asked about your progress.
- Don't code alone!
- **Obtaining help.** Ask for help at Stack Overflow, GitHub Forums, or a programming community Discord server.
- **Speeding through courses**. Move at a pace where you're confident in your understanding of the material.
- **Textbooks**. Sites like FreeCodeCamp and College Compendium provide ways to find free textbooks.
- Complementary Learning.
- **Additional Enrichment**. Dive into the details with academic papers from sites like PapersWithCode.

# Common Pitfalls
- **Time mismanagement.** Setting enough time aside for your audit can be difficult. Consistently re-adjust your schedule as needed.

- Have others quiz you; Join an online community.
- Try and apply the knowledge in some way; Build a project.

# Next Steps
- Consider auditing courses sequentially to build on previous concepts.
- Consider mixing and matching courses from various sources.
- Prioritize foundational math. Calculus, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math.
- There's always more to learn!
