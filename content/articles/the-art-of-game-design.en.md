*Game design is not about building games—it’s about creating experiences.*

---

## ✨ 1. The Designer’s Role: Listener & Visionary

* **Listen** to your team, audience, client, and even yourself.
* **Create** experiences; without them, games are just code and art.

**TOL (Tool of Learning):** *What emotion do I want my player to feel? Why?*

## 🧠 2. Foundations: Psychology, Anthropology & Design

1. **Psychology**: How players think and feel.
2. **Anthropology**: Cultural venues (private, public) where games live.
3. **Design**: Solving problems with creativity.

## 🎲 3. Fun & Play

* **Fun = Pleasure + Surprise**
* **Play** is manipulated curiosity.

## 🔑 4. Key Qualities of Games

Games are **voluntary, goal-driven, conflicted, rule-based, and interactive**. They can be **won or lost**, offer **challenge**, and generate **internal value**.

| Feedback  | Immediate responses to player actions |

**TOL:** *What is valuable to the players in my game?*

## 🧩 5. Problem Solving & Puzzles

* Games are **problem-solving activities** approached playfully.
* Remove problems → remove the game.

**TOL:** *How can my game generate new problems so players return?*

* **Mechanics**: Rules, actions, chance.
* **Story**: Narrative arc, characters, transformation.
* **Aesthetics**: Visuals, sound, emotional tone.
* **Technology**: Medium that makes play possible.

**TOL:** *What makes my game feel powerful and special?*

## 🌟 7. Theme & Problem Statements

* **Theme**: The unifying idea that gives meaning.
* **Problem-first**: Love the problem, not the solution.
* **Good statement**: Defines both goal and constraint.

**TOL:** *What core problem am I solving? Is a game the best solution?*
