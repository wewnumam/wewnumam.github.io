Understanding the types of game pitch decks and the key components that publishers expect can significantly enhance your chances of securing their interest and support.

## Types of Game Pitch Decks:

1. **Presenting pitch deck:** This type of pitch is used for direct presentations to individuals or groups and should be concise and straightforward.
