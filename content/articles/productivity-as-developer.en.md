- Deadlines are like a compass, guiding us towards the completion of our projects.
- Without deadlines, it is easy for us to fall into the trap of procrastination.
- Setting deadlines helps us prioritize our tasks and allocate our time accordingly.
- The further the deadline, the more work can be prolonged unnecessarily.
- Setting unrealistic deadlines can be counter-productive and cause stress.
- It is important to find a balance and set deadlines that are challenging but achievable.

# 3 Pillars of Motivation

- Example: learning a framework like React JS. 
	- Associate pain with not learning React JS (e.g. job loss, missed opportunities).
