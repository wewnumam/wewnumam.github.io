MARKETING How will you get the word out about your business? Online? Posters? Through the Newspaper? By Email? Where will you sell your products or services? PRICING How much will you charge? What are your competitors charging? PROFIT How much will you make on each sale after you subtract your expenses? Profit = Income - Expenses Sale price of item, Cost of item, Profit What will you do with the money you make? Reinvest in the business? Save for college? Donate? Website \u0026 Portofolio Your portfolio is a key aspect to your success. This gives clients something to look at to prove to them you can do the job. If you have no work to show, use some personal projects.\nSocial Media \u0026 Web Presence ✅ Twitter ✅ Facebook ✅ LinkedIn ✅ Blog Articles ✅ Stack Overflow ✅ Reddit ✅ GitHub Step 3: Establish Your Freelance Presence Now it’s time to expose yourself as freelancer. This includes both freelancing websites and other methods.\nFreelance Websites ✅ Upwork.com ✅ Freelancer.com ✅ Fiverr.com ✅ Toptal.com ✅ Upstack.co ✅ Guru.com Optimize Your Profile ✅ Captivating Title \u0026 Description ✅ Clear \u0026 Professional Picture ✅ Portfolio \u0026 Past Work ✅ Past Client Work ✅ Categorize Yourself Correctly Set Your Pricing Come up with a pricing scale. There are many pricing methods:\n✅ Hourly ✅ Fixed (Project-Based) ✅ Ongoing Pricing Apply For Jobs Now you can start applying for jobs on freelancing sites. You should apply to as many as you can, but be sure that you are qualified for whatever you apply to. When you apply for a job, you will write an initial proposal.\nProposals Learn how to write excellent proposals that grab clients’ attention and increase your chances of landing jobs.\nOther Ways To Find Clients ✅ Local Outreach ✅ Cold Emails ✅ Content Creation ✅ Referrals \u0026 Word Of Mouth ✅ Social Media ✅ Friends \u0026 Family ✅ Freelance Agencies ✅ Directories Like Yelp ✅ Networking, Conferences, Meetups Step 4: Your Workflow Now it’s time to get work. You may have a rough start, but you will eventually have a smooth workflow for each project.\nDiscovery Have an initial discovery phase where you talk to the client and ask questions and get all of the information that you can as well as any assets including images, content, etc.\nProposal \u0026 Contract Delivery Deliver your proposal along with a contract to be signed that outlines the work to be done, deadline, budget and payment schedule\nInvoicing \u0026 Payment You will need a way to collect payment from your client. There are a lot of different options for this. Find one that makes it very easy for the client to pay.\n✅ PayPal ✅ Venmo ✅ Stripe ✅ FreshBooks ✅ Bonsai ✅ QuickBooks ✅ BookiPi ✅ Invoicely Communication \u0026 Updates After the initial consult, have regular updates about the project including what you’ve done and what you are currently working on.\nProductivity Tools You will also come up with some tools to make life easier for you and help you stay organized.\n✅ Development Tools (Editors, IDES, Extensions) ✅ Al Tools (CharGPT, Midjourney, Copilot) ✅ Project \u0026 Task Management (Trello, Notion, Asana, Todoist) ✅ Time Tracking \u0026 Billing (Clockify, Toggl, Harvest) ✅ Code Collaboration (GitHub, GitLab, CodeSandbox) ✅ Deployment \u0026 Hosting (Vercel, Netlify, Digital Ocean, CPanel) Step 5: On Going Work With every client, you have opportunity to turn a one-time project into a recurring service and make an ongoing income.\nOngoing Service Offerings As a freelancer, you can gain some of the following skills to provide ongoing services\n✅ Website Maintenance ✅ Tech Support ✅ SEO \u0026 Marketing ✅ Web Hosting ✅ Content Writing ✅ Social Networking Management Upselling Clients Pitch ongoing work to clients where it makes sense.\nStep 6: Outsourcing \u0026 Scaling There will come a time where you will need help in order to keep growing you can start to think about outsourcing or possibly hiring employees\nOutsourcing Help You can search for help on the same freelance websites where you applied for jobs.\nHiring In-House You can hire in-house employees, just know that it starts to get a bit more complicated. If you’re a sole proprietorship, you will need to change to an LLC or S-Corp and add payroll services. Having employees can be a lot of work and can cause some stress, but it can really bring your business to the next level and bring you from freelancer to an employer and the owner of an agency.\nScaling Your Business In addition to hiring, you can scale your business in terms of expanding your workspace, license or white-label your work, offer things like consulting and coaching and more.\nSource:
