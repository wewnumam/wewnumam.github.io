If the camera looks at the same thing for too long or is not looking at something the viewer wants to see, the viewer will get bored.\nSporting events on TV are usually captured with a dozen to dozens of different cameras-every few seconds moving to a different image. And each image focuses on new information. Each image has meaning, and the cuts between them provide a lot of information without boring the audience.\nEvery time you shoot a camera, think, who are we going to shoot? What are they doing? Is it interesting? If not, cut it out and find something else to shoot.\nDon’t keep the camera on non-stop. Even if you are going to edit it, this is a bad habit that will only waste your time because you will have to watch dozens of useless and unusable pieces of video.\nShoot When the Whites of the Subject’s Eyes Are Visible People communicate half of what they say with their mouths and the other half with their eyes. If we miss the eyes, we will miss half of the message.\nSubtle patterns on the face make up half the communication between people.\nOur videos instantly become 200 percent better if we stay close to the subject to clearly capture the whites of their eyes.\nAlways Take Pictures Under 10 Seconds in Length Short cuts are part of the modern movie language.\nA mix of different short videos has more information and feeling than if the video was shot continuously.\nZooming with Feet 10x zoom = 10x more shake.\nUse recording tools that help us overcome camera shake due to our hands. To prevent camera shake, we can attach a tripod or stabilizer-or make use of a flat plane around the location.\nTo get a good close-up, set the camera lens to a wide angle (aka no zoom at all). Physically walk up to the subject and take a picture.\nThings to remember about digital zoom:\nDon’t. Don’t ever use it.\nDon’t Move! Don’t Shake! And Don’t zoom During Shooting! Treat the video camera like a photographic camera.\nAim the lens. Keep your finger away from the zoom button. Look at the LCD screen to make sure the picture is good. And, press start.\nStop after getting the image, and repeat. The rhythm we follow is Move, Shoot, Record, Stop.\nArrange for Light to Come from Behind the Camera The camera gets confused when it has to deal with several different exposure levels in the same shot.\nMost video cameras will expose for the largest and brightest object in the frame.\nIf the light is in front of the camera, then the background of the subject will always be brighter. The subject we are filming will be dark.\nIf the light source stays behind the camera, the light will fall on the subjects. They will become the bright part of the frame. And we will be able to see them.\nDisable Camera Digital Effects If we take a nice, clean video, we can always add the effects we want later, using one of the many computer editing programs designed for that purpose.\nBut if we shoot a video directly with the camera’s built-in effects app, we can never get rid of them. Our video is stuck with that effect forever.\nFocus on What’s Really Interesting Every video gets better when we apply an organized principle, and it almost doesn’t matter what that principle is.\nShoot a concentration of the subject’s face, what they’re doing, the reaction of the audience, what the audience is seeing, and the mood of the location.\nFind something to focus on-a person or an interesting angle-and your video will instantly become more interesting.\nDon’t Use Amateurish Captions Don’t use captions unless it’s absolutely necessary.\nHere are some important tips to apply when using captions:\nKeep the text short and the words simple. Use a simple, easy-to-read font (sans-serif font category).\nDon’t let the text interfere with the important parts of the image and make sure it remains easy to read.\nPlace it at the top or bottom third of the screen.\nUse white letters on a black background or black on a light color-don’t add shadow, outline, underline, motion, or glow.\nDo not use vertical writing.\nUse white letters on a black background or black on a light color-do not add shadow, outline, underline, motion, or glow.\nDo not use vertical writing.\nIf the background of your image is half-bright so that the text is hard to read with black or white text colors, put a simple rectangular box behind the text.\nDisplay the text on the screen about one-tap longer than the time it takes you to read it out loud.\nLike everything else in the video, keep the text simple but elegant.\nKeep the Video Short Whatever is appropriate to say in a video should be said in a short way.\nTV commercials tell a complete story, entertain us, and sell us-all in 30 seconds.\nThe best way to make your video shorter is to intend for it to be short in the first place.\nWhen in doubt, cut it.\nUse an external microphone Most video cameras set their own sound levels. That means they take whatever they hear and amplify it to a constant, audible level.\nUnfortunately, if the camera hears noise around it, it will also turn it up. Traffic noise, sirens, and crowd noise-all are amplified.\nIf we get as close to the subject as possible, there will be fewer problems.\nTo make it no problem at all use a good clip on mic. Clip the clip on to the subject’s shirt, and this sound problem will be over.\nSource: Stockman, S. (2011). How to Shoot Video That Doesn’t Suck: Advice to Make Any Amateur Look Like a Pro.
