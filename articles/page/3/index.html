Understanding the types of game pitch decks and the key components that publishers expect can significantly enhance your chances of securing their interest and support.
Types of Game Pitch Decks: Presenting pitch deck: This type of pitch is used for direct presentations to individuals or groups and should be concise and straightforward. Sent-out pitch deck: This pitch is indirectly sent via email and should provide more extensive information to compensate for the absence of direct interaction. Key Components of a Game Pitch: Game Summary: This section should contain the game’s concept, game design elements, and sample artwork. It serves as a snapshot of what your game is all about. Cost, Opportunities, and Production Roadmap: This component outlines the potential profitability, marketing strategies, key milestones, and budget allocation for the game’s production. Team Profile: Highlight the achievements or relevant portfolio of your team members to showcase their expertise and experience. Pro Tips: Unique Game Concept and Market Potential: Publishers are more likely to engage with games that offer unique experiences, although they also bear higher risks. Publishers will be interested in your game if it has a market demand. Understand Player Motivation: Clearly explain the objectives and factors that will captivate players. What makes your game compelling and attractive? Showcase Engaging Game Art: Include the best key points of your game art to convey the vibe and visual appeal of your game. Know Your Market Position: Understand the competitive landscape and highlight how your game stands out within the market of similar games. Ensure it is advantageous. Committed Development Team: Demonstrate that you have a dedicated full-time development team committed to your game project. Basic Rule of Thumb: Grab Attention Early: Ensure the most captivating aspects of your game are presented within the first 1-2 minutes of your pitch to capture the publisher’s interest. Emphasize Fun and Appeal: Clearly explain why your game is fun and what makes it appealing to players. Appropriate Scope and Pricing: Convince publishers that your game has a suitable scope and reasonable pricing by explaining the costs and opportunities involved. Highlight Team Achievements: Introduce the track record and accomplishments of your team members to establish their capability to deliver the game. Conclusion: Crafting an effective game pitch requires careful attention to the expectations of publishers. By incorporating the suggested components and adhering to the provided tips, you can enhance your chances of successfully pitching your game and securing the support of a publisher. Remember, a compelling pitch can significantly impact the trajectory of your game’s development and success in the competitive gaming industry.

It’s important to have clear goals and start by giving our maximum effort, even if it seems small.
Here are some key mindsets to cultivate in order to thrive in the game industry:
Technical skills are not enough While technical skills are important, they alone are not sufficient to make a living or build a career in the game industry. It requires a multidisciplinary approach and a combination of technical, artistic, and business skills.

Mobile games account for 45% in 2021 and 53% in 2022 of the global gaming market. Indonesians spend 25 trillion rupiah a year on games, mostly to get items that increase social strata in games. Challenges of the gaming industry in Indonesia: the comparison between the spending of Indonesian gamers on games and the income of Indonesian game developers is still very far (1000:1). Obstacles in making games: lack of funds (66.7%), lack of human resources (44.4%), lack of skills (36.1%), others (26.4%). Why there are few successful local game developers in Indonesia: Business Model; Market Visibility; Access To Funding. Business model challenges: premium (sales conversion & product experience) and freemium (live ops & reading data) Market visibility challenge: pc gamers are more open to games with similar genres while mobile gamers tend to be enthusiastic about 1 game only. Longer life time and limited storage space make mobile gamers rarely look for other games in the same genre. Access to funding challenges: premium (market similar to publisher) and freemium (market validation before funding). Trends in mobile games: Game as a Service (live service and in-app purchase) revenue is greater than full game. Trends in game purchasing power in developing countries: very sensitive to price, micro-transactions are more suitable than one-time purchases. Pay attention to the development of cloud gaming and subscription based model. Other strategies that can be taken: capitalize on viral trends, local wisdom, niche markets. In terms of revenue, it makes more sense to target the global market, but in the local market, we know the market better, so competition is easier. Relatibility is a challenge when promoting local wisdom, the unique selling point must be generally accepted. Game trends are changing, all market segments need games, make sure to test games to the right target market.

This will help you to choose the right group of playtesters and create a test scenario that closely simulates the final product.
Before the playtest, prepare a list of questions that you want to ask your playtesters, and set up a system for collecting feedback. This can be done through a survey or through verbal feedback during the playtest. Additionally, make sure you have all the necessary materials and equipment ready, such as game boards, cards, dice, and any other components that are needed for the game.

Many adults enjoy the chance to fill their heads with thoughts and emotions unrelated to work or school, while others are drawn to the challenge and opportunity to test their abilities. Games offer a sense of efficiency and order that may be lacking in everyday life, and can provide a sense of excitement and relaxation.
