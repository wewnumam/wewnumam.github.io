Achieve your coding goals, your plan or path to achieve those goals, the steps, routines, habits and timelines required to achieve your goals. Recognize myths or mismatched expectations that stand in the way of learning to program. Use effective tools and strategies + discouragement-tree. Recognize pitfalls & diversions that cause delays and derailment. Be a highly effective lifelong-learner. Preparation + Mindset First thing to achieve your goals. All success start with get good at this. Getting most out of this course: Inertia. Frustration. Growth Mindset. Time + Effort = Goal. Time lots of it. A Framework for your journey 5 W + 1 H. Help you get total clarity & expectation from yourself, process of learning, and your definition of success. Keep referring to your plan! Are you on track with it? Does it need adjustment? The Sequence Matters: Better decisions. Demythify. Build the plan. Why do you want to learn to code? You must define your why before you can begin with the what and the how. At some point, if you ask why enough time, you will get something you strongly believe. Ask why deeply to your previous why answer. What do you want to learn based on your reason? What the skills you must have to achieve your goals? What the relevant subjects to learn? When learning a new skill focus is the absolute key. The less topics you do the more progress you make. Separate your task into ‚Äúmust have skills‚Äù and ‚Äúnice to ‚Äúhave skills‚Äù to help you focus. Who? (Models & Mentors) How else do we know were going the right way? There so many ways to get someplace, we want the shortest right? Find someone who has achieved the same goals you‚Äôre aiming for. You almost certainly know at least one person and then there is always social media. Reach out. Make it useful, not aspirational. When do I need to turn to them? When you‚Äôre confused or stuck. A good model will help you choose a step that is right for you and takes you closer to your what, efficiently and productively. Internet is full of opinions, mentor can help when you‚Äôre confused. The Mentor/Model will help guide you to the best next step for you. The right WHO includes enough to help you make better decisions (even if they cannot make the decision for you). If they‚Äôve done what you want to do, listen closely. But don‚Äôt blindly follow. If they‚Äôve not done it, maybe you should find someone who has, or at least tried. Don‚Äôt confine yourself to physical mentorship. When by? ‚ÄúWork expands to fill the time available to complete it‚Äù ~Parkinson‚Äôs law. S.M.A.R.T goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-Bound). Break it down into chunks. Each chunk must have a clear beginning and finish point. Choose metrics that can be aimed for daily/weekly. Don‚Äôt set goals too far into the future. Set the game up so you win quickly and constantly. Missing the timeline is 0K, if it‚Äôs the exception. Where (Learning Formats) Books. Multimedia experience (online course). Let‚Äôs find yours: Pick your first small learning goal. Then do it several times from different sources. Should take no more than 10 hours across all your learning formats. Fundamentals feel strong? Now work out which formats were most effective for you. Eliminate formats until you‚Äôre left with top 2-3. Repeat with top 2-3 formats on your next small learning goal. The Sequence Matters Build the plan ‚û°Ô∏è Demythify ‚û°Ô∏è Better decisions

Productivity is all about getting things done and making the most of your time. Productivity = Time x Energy x Focus All three of them are important. Take responsibility for everything in your life You are the common denominator of all your problems. Take ownership of your actions! Are you not understanding a particular design pattern? It is your responsibility to understand it. You are more than just a coder You are a value-adding member of the team. You should aim to have a seat at the table where decisions are made. You should have a sense of ownership. Understanding the business and the value you can bring is crucial. You should partner with business and product partners. You can have unique insights into the product and its performance. Add as much value as possible Prioritize adding value over other tasks. Don‚Äôt waste time on things that don‚Äôt matter. Consider adding value in any way possible. Clarity breeds productivity Ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings and wasted time/resources. Clarify details and make sure everyone is on the same page. Ask many questions upfront and record meetings if possible. The importance of values Values guide our behavior and decision-making. Knowing your values helps align decisions with beliefs and goals. Values can help you when making difficult decisions. Values-based decisions lead to purpose, fulfillment. Set Goals Goals can make you more committed and productive. Set short-term goals that excite you, as well as long-term goals that pull you towards your dreams. Prioritize your goals based on importance and urgency. Set Deadlines Deadlines are like a compass, guiding us towards the completion of our projects. Without deadlines, it is easy for us to fall into the trap of procrastination. Setting deadlines helps us prioritize our tasks and allocate our time accordingly. The further the deadline, the more work can be prolonged unnecessarily. Setting unrealistic deadlines can be counter-productive and cause stress. It is important to find a balance and set deadlines that are challenging but achievable. 3 Pillars of Motivation Motivation is essential for staying focused and achieving goals. Dan Pink‚Äôs theory of motivation: There are 3 pillars: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Mastery: Desire for improvement and proficiency. Constantly learning and improving skills. Autonomy: Desire for control over own lives and work. Freedom to choose projects, set schedules, make decisions about work. Purpose: Desire to contribute to something larger than ourselves. Using skills and knowledge to make positive Impact on world. Solve important problems. Motivation Equation Motivation equation by Jim Kwik: Motivation = Energy x Purpose x Small Simple Steps Maintain high energy levels through sleep, diet, exercise, and breaks. A strong sense of purpose in work is essential. Break down goals into manageable steps for motivation and progress. The Importance of Emotions Emotions impact work and relationships as a software engineer. Emotions can lead to poor decisions, poor quality work, and negative interactions. Emotions are normal and necessary, but should be managed. The Imposter Syndrome Imposter syndrome is very common among software engineers. It is the feeling of doubting your skills and success. It can reduce productivity by causing self-doubt. Everyone feels it at some degree. When it comes, do not ignore it. Identify its sources. Is it happening because you are working on a new project or technology that is challenging you? Great. You have this awesome opportunity to learn. Seek feedback from others. Do not try to be perfect. Everyone has flaws. Do not compare yourself to others. Do not feel embarrassed to ask for help when you need it. 2 Forces that Shape Us Tony Robbins states that everyone has a desire to avoid pain and a desire to gain pleasure. The desire to avoid pain is often fueled by the need to protect oneself from physical or emotional harm. The desire to gain pleasure is often fueled by the need to feel good and seek out experiences that bring joy. Example: learning a framework like React JS. Associate pain with not learning React JS (e.g. job loss, missed opportunities). Associate pleasure with benefits of learning React JS (e.g. raise, interesting projects). Use reminders (paper, phone, Slack bot) to keep consequences and benefits in mind. Become grateful We have really good salaries in comparison to others We have the opportunity to work on interesting projects, from home, with people all around the world We get paid to learn. The Impact of Stress Causes: work, personal, financial, uncertainty. Negative effects: anxiety, depression, heart disease, decreased productivity. Positive effects: eustress enhances performance, motivation. Effective management: relaxation, time management, support, self-care. Time Management Time management is essential for productivity. Productive people prioritize tasks and manage time effectively. All individuals have 24 hours in a day. Time is a finite resource and should be used wisely. Tips to Manage Your Time Set goals. Create a schedule. Learn to say no. Take breaks. Stay organized. Keep track of current time usage. Batch activities to stay focused. Choose the best location for productivity. Time management is about finding what works best for you and maximizing productivity. Use a Calendar Your calendar is one of the most important productivity tools. It gives you a clear sense of time duration. Todo lists can get too long. Your calendar gives you a reality check. Create a calendar that outlines your daily schedule. Write down new commitments or appointments immediately. Use color or symbols to indicate important tasks/events. Check the calendar the day before and prioritize tasks. Procrastination Everyone procrastinates. There are many reasons why we procrastinate: Feeling overwhelmed. Unrealistic expectations. Fear of failure. Lack of motivation. Perfectionism. Lack of discipline. Lack of energy. Poor time management. RPM RPM stands for Result Focused Purpose Driven Massive Action Plan. A really Useful technique by Tony Robbins that can motivate you to work hard. The RPM technique can help you turning your goals into reality. The RPM process consists of 4 steps: Get clear on your desired result. Identify your purpose behind the goal. Create a massive action plan by breaking the goal into manageable tasks and setting deadlines for each task. Take consistent, focused action towards your goal every day. RPM Example Purpose Result Massive Action Plan (1) Become a more valuable engineer.
(2) Get a salary raise.
(3) Get promoted.
(4) Make my family proud. Become a Certified AWS Solutions Architect. (1) Research about potential resources I can use to learn.
(2) Prepare a roadmap of steps I need to follow to prepare.
(3) Learn everything necessary
(4) Pass the exam. The 2 Minute Rule It is a simple and effective technique to manage workload and increase productivity. If you can get something done in 2 minutes or less, do it immediately. It helps you get small things done quickly and not overthink them. It can be applied to tasks like: Writing Jira comments. Replying to Slack messages. Improving a typo in the documentation. The 15 Minute Rule Rule of 15 minutes is a technique to overcome procrastination. Set a timer for 15 minutes and focus solely on the task at hand for that time. 15 minutes is short enough to be easy to commit to and long enough to make progress. Progress is better than perfect, the goal is to get started and build momentum. Progress compounds, the more work done the easier it becomes and momentum builds. Try setting a timer for 15 minutes next time you are feeling stuck and make progress, no matter how small. Perfectionism Trying to do something perfectly. This is not usually not about being more. This is usually just one manifestation of procrastination. Striving for perfection can prevent us from releasing our work. Consequences of Perfectionism Endless revisions and refinements leading to delays and missed deadlines. Procrastination and a backlog of unfinished tasks. Unrealistic expectations leading to frustration and demoralization. Overwhelm and burnout. Missed deadlines and falling behind schedule. Missed opportunities for growth and innovation. Start before you feel motivated It is hard to always be motivated. The ‚Äúperfect‚Äù moment never comes. Motivation comes after you start. Break large tasks into small ones Large projects can be overwhelming and a source of procrastination . Break them into small simple tasks. Remember that the best way to start is to just start and take it one step at a time. ‚ÄúYou eat an elephant one bite at a time‚Äù. Exercise Regular exercise is important for a healthy lifestyle. It reduces stress, improves sleep, increases energy levels, and improves overall physical fitness. It lowers the risk of chronic illnesses. It also enhances cognitive function, including memory and focus. Incorporate activities like walking, biking, and swimming into daily routine . Join in an exercise class or participating in team sports. Go to the gym to relieve stress and boost mental wellbeing. Socialize with people in the local community. Quick tips for exercises Try walking or biking from time to time. Download an exercise app and do a few exercises throughout the day. Utilize a jump rope for quick cardio workouts. Do a few pushups or sit-ups throughout the day. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Do not underestimate sleep Sleep is essential for physical and mental restoration. Not sleeping well can affect: Our ability to concentrate. Our emotions and relations with others. Our health. The Importance of Focus Focus is extremely important for our productivity. Our focus is limited so we need to prioritize things. We are constantly being distracted. Focus is like a muscle Focus helps us: Get things done faster. Stay present in the moment. Reduce stress and anxiety. Have greater enjoyment and fulfillment. How to improve your focus Set clear goals and priorities. Identify distractions. Turn off non important notifications. Put your phone 6 feet away from you. Take breaks and manage energy. Multitasking is killing your Productivity Multitasking is the process of switching from one task into another. It can: Be inefficient. Slow us down. Lead to mistakes. Be a source of stress and anxiety. How to avoid multitasking Prioritize your tasks. Focus on one task at a time. Turn off distractions. Take breaks. The Pomodoro Technique It is a time management technique that helps you focus by using time-boxed intervals. The intervals are usually 25 minutes long followed by a 5 minute break. After 4 pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes) to have some proper rest. Delete Social Media Apps from Your Phone Delete social media apps from your phone. Sign out from social medias in the web browser. Now you need to take a few more steps to use them. Every minute is valuable. You are a lifelong learner Learning doesn‚Äôt end after school or training program. Software engineers must constantly learn to stay up-to-date. Embrace the mentality of being a lifelong learner. Do not Memorize the Syntax Switching programming languages is common in a career. Moving to a new language can be overwhelming, especially for beginners. Memorizing everything is not necessary. Experienced developers still need to look up information and documentation. You don‚Äôt have to be remember the syntax. You can use GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT to help you with the syntax. You are supposed to solve problems. Avoid the Tutorial Hell Watching many tutorials can give you a false impression that you are learning. You cannot learn new things by just passively watching. You get better at coding by actually coding. Be more active with project-based learning. Keep a ‚Äô ‚ÄòTO Learn" List Everyone keeps ‚ÄúTo Do‚Äù lists. There is nothing wrong with that. As a lifelong learner, you should also keep another very important list. You should keep a ‚ÄúTo Learn‚Äù list. Benefits Of Keeping ‚ÄúTo Learn‚Äù Lists It can help you stay: Curious. Motivated. Humble. Productive. Learn by Building Things From Scratch Building from scratch enhances understanding. Active learning through building. Learn principles and underlying concepts. Develop problem-solving skills. See the Bigger Picture Drive the business forward by adding value. Avoid getting lost in trivial tasks and focus on critical problems. Increase value and productivity by investing time wisely in high-impact areas. The Feynman Technique There is a difference between just knowing the name of something and actually understanding something. The Feynman Technique can help you understand complex topics. The technique is a four-step process: Choose a topic that you want to learn. Teach it to yourself or someone else. Whenever you get stuck, go back to the book, or course. Use simple examples and analogies. Learn to build something that already exists Avoid overwhelming yourself with complex business decisions. Clone open-source projects. Replicate projects you already use. Keep learning simple. Learn Concepts not Specific Problems Understand concepts, not just memorize solutions. Learn underlying principles, design patterns, and best practices. Increase problem-solving efficiency and effectiveness. Work on side projects You need to improve your skills. Side projects can serve as a sandbox to try out new technologies, frameworks. No need to finish complete apps. Even prototypes can help you learn a lot. Be Kind to Yourself There is so much to learn and get done. We may feel overwhelmed, anxious, and stressed. It is very important to prioritize our own well-being. Practice self-compassion. Develop Positive Relationships with Your Family Quality family time boosts motivation and drive. Open communication sets healthy boundaries. Active listening and respect foster positivity. Appreciation and gratitude fuel success. Build Positive Relationships at Work Build relationships with colleagues. Listen and respect. Show appreciation for colleagues work. Offer assistance and be a team player. Meet new people Meeting new people helps you: Expand your professional circle. Get involved in new opportunities. Develop new skills and experiences. Be open to meeting people whenever there is an opportunity. You can grow both personally and professionally. Log Your Achievements We accomplish a lot of things in our work: Fix critical bugs. Finish urgent tasks. Your work can have a really profound impact on the project. As times goes by, we forget about them. As such, it is extremely important to log our achievements. When we log our achievements, we can: Track our progress. Identify areas of improvement. Feel a higher sense of meaning and satisfaction. Feel more confident. Have higher levels of happiness. How to Log Your Achievements Use a document to list accomplishments, trainings, and relevant details. Capture positive feedback (emails, Jira comments, personal messages) as reminders. Track achievements for improvement and impact. Learn to write Effective writing is crucial for software developers. Writing saves time and prevents misunderstandings. It boosts productivity, credibility, and career growth. ‚ÄúWhat many people underestimate is that being a good writer, whether that is through emails or through documents. allows you to be more impactful. I see many engineers ignore that skill. You might be proud of your code. You should also be equally proud of the craft of writing‚Ä¶ Writing is a highly underestimated skill for engineers.‚Äù Urs H√∂lzle, Google‚Äôs first VP of Engineering. Power Up Your Career with Presentations Presentations enhance careers and skills. Sharing knowledge through presentations builds confidence and expertise. Overcoming the fear of public speaking fuels personal and professional growth. Learn keyboard shortcuts Keyboard shortcuts save time and reduce hand movements. Learn shortcuts for common tasks. Mastering shortcuts boosts productivity and makes work more enjoyable. Master debugging Software Engineers spend more time debugging than coding. Invest time getting better at it. Use logs and read error messages carefully. Use debugging tools: breakpoints. watch windows. call stacks. Improve Your Typing Speed Typing is a big part of our daily lives: emails, messages, documents. Faster typing means more productivity and efficiency. Practice can improve your typing speed. Just 5-10 minutes a day for a few weeks can make a significant difference. Conclusion Knowledge is not power. Knowledge is potential power. Applied knowledge is actual power. It is very important to practice what you learn.
