Autodidactic Learning

You determine the topic you study, the source you learn from, and when you learn it.

Flexible
Non-Sequential
Other Incentives
Independent


Self-proclaimed &ldquo;unlettered man.&rdquo;
Less than 3 years of formal schooling.
Partly taught himself how to code.
Learning on the Internet.

Ask Yourself&mldr;

What do I want to learn?
Why do I want to learn it?
When do I want to learn it?
Are there prerequisites?
Are these resources accurate and trustworthy?

Insight

Ensure your topic aligns with your goals.
Popular topics: python, algorithms, data structures.
Experiment before committing!

How to Choose the Right Course
What&rsquo;s your learning style?

How do you prefer to learn?
Visual: Do you prefer to learn with graphical depictions such as charts/images?
Auditory: Do you prefer to learn when listening to others present, such as in lectures?

How Do You Define Success?

Know what the course offers before you dive in!
Is it match with your goals?
Track your progress!

Making the Most of Your Audit

Set realistic schedules. Evaluate how you can work a course audit into your schedule.
Be organized! Make an actionable plan and stick to it as best you can. Set a reasonable schedule for yourself.
Be consistent! Ensure you are studying at the pace you set for yourself. Re-evaluate if issues arise.
Be studious! Review material frequently! Stay disciplined and try to avoid multitasking while learning.
Be motivated! Set short-term goals and reward yourself when you achieve them!
Be persistent! It&rsquo;s impossible to &ldquo;fail&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re in charge! If you&rsquo;re struggling with something, take your time.
Be accountable! Find someone to ask you about the course, or put yourself into a position to be asked about your progress.
Don&rsquo;t code alone!
Obtaining help. Ask for help at Stack Overflow, GitHub Forums, or a programming community Discord server.
Speeding through courses. Move at a pace where you&rsquo;re confident in your understanding of the material.
Textbooks. Sites like FreeCodeCamp and College Compendium provide ways to find free textbooks.
Complementary Learning.
Additional Enrichment. Dive into the details with academic papers from sites like PapersWithCode.

Common Pitfalls

Time mismanagement. Setting enough time aside for your audit can be difficult. Consistently re-adjust your schedule as needed.
Getting distracted. Many students lose energy or interest. TV, social media, and more can also take up valuable time.
Not engaging with other learners. Take advantage of other means of social learning online!

Ways To Confirm Your Knowledge

Quiz yourself; Flashcards - Quizlet, Brainscape, Anki.
Have others quiz you; Join an online community.
Try and apply the knowledge in some way; Build a project.

Next Steps

Consider auditing courses sequentially to build on previous concepts.
Consider mixing and matching courses from various sources.
Prioritize foundational math. Calculus, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math.
There&rsquo;s always more to learn!
